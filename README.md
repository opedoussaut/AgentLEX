# AgentLEX
AgentLEX is a multi-agent system that discovers, extracts, and tracks regulatory requirements for any product. It identifies relevant EU (and optional global) regulations, stores structured data, detects updates on later runs, generates compliance summaries, and evaluates its own performance.
